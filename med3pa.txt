Mary DeSimone (med3pa)
I have taken ECE Comp Arch, EAR 1 & 2, and I am currently taking Operating Systems. I know pyhton, Java, C, C++, and C# well.
I am interested in pursuing robotics as a career and really liked the previous embedded courses I have taken. I am hoping to gain some new knowledge about embedded systems that will hopefully help prepare me for either graduate school or industry! In my spare time, I do a lot of work with the Society of Women Engineers, and I love to volunteer and do outreach programs!
