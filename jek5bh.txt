John Kothmann - jek5bh

I have taken a few computer architecture courses, but I don't have too much dedicated embedded systems experience in terms of coursework. I have taken one general undergrad OS course as well. I have self-taught some embedded systems material by working with an Arduino microcontroller to do a few things, and I am currently in the process of implementing an RFID access control system for an organization I volunteer for using raspberry pi and arduino. I am proficient with C, C++, and Java, and have some experience with C#, Python, and x86 assembly.

In this class, I hope to learn how to design embedded systems for useful applications, and hopefully get the chance to actually build a few cyber-physical systems out from start to finish, so that I can get a good grasp on the entire design and implementation process. I am particularly interested in designing embedded "smart" devices and being able to run somewhat more complex algorithms in the resource-limited environment of an embedded system. On the whole, I want this class to bring my prior experience together and allow me to apply it more effectively to physical computing and embedded systems.
